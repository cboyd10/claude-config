# Skill roadmap — deferred work

Seed notes for future skill-building sessions. Each entry gets its own
grill-with-docs session. Written 2026-07-02 during the Sonnet-readiness audit.

## Seed entries

- **build-style-guide: Figma as a seed source.** Work clients receive designs
  in Figma; extend build-style-guide's seed intake (currently claude.ai/design
  export / reference app / current app) to extract tokens and element styling
  from Figma. Deferred 2026-07-04 during the build-style-guide grilling
  session.

- **Native blocked-by for dependencies.** The DEPENDS-ON LINE text convention is
  the sole dependency signal because the GitHub MCP exposes no issue-dependency
  tools (verified 2026-07-05: only sub-issues, labels, fields). When the MCP gains
  native blocked-by support: update plan-to-github to set the relationship
  alongside the text line, and sweep-issues-personal to read native first with
  text fallback. Deferred 2026-07-05 during the sweep-issues-personal grilling
  session.

- **update-docs: module README template — optional Key Data Structures and Configuration Reference sections.** Surfaced 2026-07-06 during an update-docs session on duebotv3 (migrator-service). The template ends at Running tests; for Spring Boot services with complex domain objects, two extra sections proved genuinely useful: Key Data Structures (field-by-field tables for core entities/DTOs) and Configuration Reference (one-row-per-property table for all `application.*` properties). Both were kept in the rewritten doc. Open questions for grilling: optional sections vs a separate "data-heavy" template variant; whether the duplication with Javadoc/OpenAPI is load-bearing (junior-friendly prose) or noise; drift signals (class-name grep for data structures, `application*.yml` changes for config reference).

## Pending chore

- Decide whether the `bitbucket_pr_to_review` script (currently
  `~/.local/bin/`) should live in this repo (e.g. under `scripts/`).
