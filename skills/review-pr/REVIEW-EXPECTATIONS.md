# Review Expectations

> Distilled from the internal "LMS Team PR Expectations" wiki doc (last refreshed
> 2026-07-02). When the user provides an updated copy, propose a diff to this file.

Only what a reviewer needs at review time. Author-side process (Teams chat,
merging checklist, approval mechanics) is intentionally omitted.

## Comment ethos

- Focus on the **code, never the developer**. Be kind. Leave your ego at the door.
- Comments must be **objective, specific, and outcome-focused**.
- **Back every suggestion with facts** — not personal preference.
- Use comments for small or self-explanatory feedback. For larger or more
  complex feedback, **communicate directly with the author** rather than through
  comments (this is the "Discuss-directly" disposition).

## Review Focus lenses

- **Complexity** — Can you understand the code? Will a different developer (or the
  author, later) still follow it? Flag "workaround" or "temporary" code that needs
  a permanent fix.
- **Consistency** — Does it follow working, established patterns already in the
  project? Is there an opportunity to reuse existing code or libraries?
- **Conventions** — Are industry-wide and library/framework/language conventions
  followed?
- **Documentation** — Missing documentation is a blocker for approval. Code changes
  that require doc updates but don't include them are **Blocking**.
- **Error handling** — Is error handling consistent across the codebase? Are edge
  cases handled? If an error-handling gap exists but is out of scope, is it at least
  referenced by a TODO?
- **Naming** — The team prefers **longer, more specific names** that are easier to
  understand. A naming concern should be raised as a comment that starts a team
  discussion about how to rename.
- **Scalability** — Does it refactor/rewrite without much impact? Can it handle
  future scenarios that are slightly different?
- **Security** — Does the PR follow the security standards? See `SECURITY-CHECKLIST.md`.
- **Tests** — **Missing tests are a blocker.** Tests must be meaningful and
  purposeful. Rare exceptions where no test is relevant: client styling or
  configuration.

## Blocking issues

Issues that impact functionality, security, or maintainability and must be
addressed by the author before approval:

- **Core functionality** — Code doesn't meet the intended functionality per the PR
  description or acceptance criteria.
- **Security issues** — Introduces vulnerabilities that expose personal/sensitive
  data or compromise the system.
- **Code standards violations** — Deviates majorly from established team, project,
  or style conventions.
- **Code smells** — Poor structure, readability, or antipatterns.
- **Regression** — Unintended side effects, or breaks existing functionality.
- **Performance issues** — Negatively impacts performance or resource usage (e.g.
  network requests, database calls, large in-memory lists, loops).
- **Failing tests** — Changes cause existing tests to fail. (As a reviewer, do not
  run suites — CI owns this — but call out changes that clearly break tests.)
- **Missing tests** — A change with testable behavior and no test.
- **Documentation** — Changes that require doc updates but haven't been made.

For each blocking finding, leave a comment tagged as blocking **with an
explanation of why** it is blocking, so it can be discussed.

## Non-blocking issues

Issues that do not impact functionality, security, or maintainability, and can be
handled by a separate PR, minor update, or as constructive feedback:

- **Style preferences** — Style differing from your own; minor spacing/indentation.
- **Documentation nitpicks** — Minor inconsistencies, typos, non-impacting issues.
- **Missing but optional features** — Core functionality is met but an optional
  feature mentioned in passing is absent.
- **Minor refactor opportunities** — Improvements that don't impact functionality
  and can be a separate PR.
- **Unrelated improvements** — Suggestions unrelated to this PR, for a separate PR.

## PR hygiene a reviewer can verify

- **Title** — contains the Jira issue number and a summary.
- **Description** — states what changed, why, and how to test.

A hygiene miss becomes a PR-level note; it is not a blocker on its own.
