name: review-pr
description: Review a COWORKER'S open pull request to produce paste-ready review comments. Triages findings, reaches explicit alignment with the user, then writes ready-to-paste Bitbucket comments and tasks. Use when the user invokes /review-pr, says "review this PR", or "review {coworker}'s PR". Distinct from address-pr-comments, which handles comments left on the USER'S OWN PRs.

# review-pr

You are reviewing a coworker's open pull request to produce review comments the
user will post. This is the mirror image of `address-pr-comments`: there you
respond to feedback on the user's PR; here the user *is* the reviewer and you
help them generate feedback on someone else's PR.

Input is `/review-pr @{handoff-file}.md {junior|mid}`. The handoff is generated
by the `bitbucket_pr_to_review` script and describes one PR: title, description,
author, source/target branch, clone URL, and any existing open comment/task
threads. The final consumer is the user, who pastes comments into Bitbucket by
hand — this skill never posts, resolves, or approves anything.

The tier arg (`junior` or `mid`) sets the voice of the written comments. It is
optional; if omitted, ask once at session start. If the user does not answer,
default to `junior` voice.

## Workflow

Run these phases strictly in order. Write nothing to disk until Phase 3
alignment is explicitly confirmed by the user.

```
1. ORIENT  →  2. REVIEW  →  3. TRIAGE (gate)  →  4. WRITE
```

### Phase 1: ORIENT

Before presenting anything to the user:

1. Parse the handoff: title, description, author, source branch, target branch,
   clone URL, and every existing open comment/task thread. Those existing
   threads are **feedback already given** — do not duplicate them later.
2. Create or reuse a worktree on the handoff's **source branch**, following the
   pickup-issue convention:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git worktree add ../<repo>-worktrees/{SOURCE-BRANCH} origin/{SOURCE-BRANCH}
   ```

   If the worktree path already exists, reuse it. Work inside it for the review.
3. PR hygiene check. The title should contain the Jira issue number and a
   summary; the description should cover what changed, why, and how to test. Any
   miss becomes a PR-level note, not a blocker on its own.
4. Locate the acceptance criteria with a three-step fallback (in a work repo,
   resolve the shared-doc root per `WORKTREE-CONTEXT.md` before this lookup):
   a. Look up the Jira slug from the PR title in `.claude/jira-planning/issues.csv`;
      if found, read the referenced planning file for the ACs.
   b. Otherwise, use the PR description as the AC source.
   c. Otherwise, ask the user to paste the Jira issue description and ACs.
5. Read `.claude/context/CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` (or legacy
   `.claude/context/adr/`) if they exist (same resolved root as step 4).

Output a brief orientation summary (3–5 lines: PR title, author, branch,
existing-feedback count, and **which AC source you are reviewing against**).
Naming the AC source lets the user catch a stale planning file. Do not dump
file listings or raw comment text.

### Phase 2: REVIEW

Review the **aggregate diff** of the source branch against the target branch:

```bash
git diff origin/{target}...{source}
```

Findings anchor to file and line in this final diff. Commit messages are
secondary context only.

**Read the diff and the changed files inline in the main session** — the diff is
the review subject, so do not delegate reading it. Delegate only broad
contextual searches (e.g. "find the existing pagination pattern this should
match") to **one** Explore agent, per `grill-with-docs/EXPLORATION.md` (read it
now if you have not).

Review through these lenses (the team's "Review Focus" vocabulary):

- **Complexity** — can a future developer follow it? Flag workaround/temporary code.
- **Consistency** — does it follow established patterns already in the project? Reuse opportunities?
- **Conventions** — industry, language, framework, library conventions honored?
- **Documentation** — required doc updates that were not made are Blocking.
- **Error handling** — consistent, edge cases covered.
- **Naming** — the team prefers longer, more specific names; raise a naming concern as a discussion starter.
- **Scalability** — refactorable, handles slightly different future scenarios.
- **Security** — check against `SECURITY-CHECKLIST.md` in this skill directory.
- **Tests** — missing tests are Blocking; tests must assert behavior, not implementation.
- **Domain fidelity** — names and terms in the diff checked against `.claude/context/CONTEXT.md`, decisions against `docs/adr/` (or legacy `.claude/context/adr/`), when those exist.

Read `REVIEW-EXPECTATIONS.md` in this skill directory for the lens essences and
the blocking/non-blocking definitions.

**Code-smell calibration.** Prefer established patterns — but a deviation is not
automatically a finding. The question is whether the new pattern solves the
problem demonstrably better. Simplicity cuts both ways: over-engineering and
verbosity are findings just as much as under-engineering. Readability and
maintainability are the bar.

**Explicit exclusions.**
- No style nits a linter or formatter would catch.
- Do **not** run the test suites — CI owns green/red. But **do** read the tests
  as first-class review targets. Missing tests, or tests asserting implementation
  details instead of behavior, are Blocking findings (the team is TDD; see the
  `tdd` skill's behavior-through-public-interfaces rule).
- Do not re-raise anything already covered by an existing open thread from the
  handoff.

### Phase 3: TRIAGE (gate)

Present every finding in one message as a table — this is not a
one-question-at-a-time interview:

| # | File / Line | Finding | Disposition | Reasoning |
|---|-------------|---------|-------------|-----------|

Dispositions:

| Disposition | When to use |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Blocking** | Core functionality/ACs not met, security, major standards violation, code smell, regression, performance, failing/missing tests, or un-updated docs. |
| **Non-blocking** | Style preference, doc nitpick, optional feature, minor refactor opportunity, or unrelated improvement. |
| **Discuss-directly** | Feedback too large or complex for a comment — the team doc says communicate directly with the author instead. |

The user culls rows, downgrades dispositions, or adds findings you missed.
Discuss disagreement before finalizing. Stay in this phase until the user
**explicitly** confirms (e.g. "looks good", "agreed", "write it up"). Never
declare alignment yourself. Write nothing to disk before confirmation.

### Phase 4: WRITE

Produce `review-comments-{PROJECT}-{REPO}-{ID}.md` in the CWD. This name is
deliberately distinct from `pr-review-*.md`, which means "comments for me to
address" — do not confuse the two.

Structure:

1. **Header** — PR title/URL, author, tier, and the AC source used.
2. **PR-level summary comment** (optional) — an overall paste-ready note. This is
   where a teaching tone earns the most for juniors.
3. **Findings**, ordered by file/line, each a ready-to-paste Bitbucket comment:
   - **Blocking** findings are marked as Bitbucket **tasks**, and their comment
     text includes the "why this is blocking" explanation the team requires.
   - **Non-blocking** findings render as ordinary paste-ready comments.
   - **Discuss-directly** items render as talking points for a conversation —
     not paste-ready comments.

**Tier voice** (never write the tier judgment into the comment text itself):

- **junior** — teaching style. Explain the *why*, offer the simpler alternative,
  and name a file that demonstrates the pattern to copy.
- **mid** — terse, intent-level. Flag the risk rather than prescribe the fix.

## General conduct

- Never write to disk before Phase 3 alignment is explicitly confirmed.
- The user posts every comment and task to Bitbucket manually. This skill never
  posts, resolves, or approves anything.
- The user can jump phases backward at any time. Honor it, then resume.
- If the review uncovers work that deserves its own issue, suggest
  `/plan-with-me` after the review document is written.
